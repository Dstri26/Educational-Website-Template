The College of Engineering & Technology, Bhubaneswar was established by the Government of Odisha in 1981 to meet the growing technical man power need in the State. It was a Constituent College of the Odisha University of Agriculture & Technology, Bhubaneswar since inception. After creation of a Technical University for Odisha State, the College has become a Constituent College of Biju Patnaik University of Technology (BPUT), Odisha with effect from 09th July, 2002 as per section-37(1) of BPUT Act, 2002.</br> </br>
 
         
    
The College is located in the Techno-campus (an area of more than 100 Acres) at Kalinga Nagar, Bhubaneswar about 2.0 Kms. away from Khandagiri-Udayagiri caves. The College was shifted to the new Techno Campus in March, 2001. A full-fledged branch of Syndicate Bank is operating in the college campus. At present, students are residing in the Ladies Hostel (KCHR) of 500 capacity and a Boys Hostel (RHR) of 500 capacity inside the campus. Boys are also staying in a rented Hostel very near to Campus. The construction of another Ladies Hostel and Boys Hostel, Academic & Administrative Blocks with four-stored buildings, Bank ATM facility, Sports complex (gym), etc. are under full swing. Limited numbers of faculty quarters are available inside the campus.

 </br> </br>

The College offers a five-year Under Graduate degree courses in Architecture (B.Arch.) and four-years B.Tech. degree in Biotechnology, Civil Engineering, Computer Science & Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Fashion & Apparel Technology, Information Technology, Instrumentation & Electronics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Textile Engineering. A three year Post Graduate course, Master in Computer Application (MCA) is also offered. In addition to the above courses M.Tech. courses in Structural Engineering (in the Department of Civil Engineering), Computer Science & Engineering, Information Technology and Industrial Engineering & Management (in Mechanical Engineering Department) have been running from Academic Year 2005-06. Master degree programme in Architecture i.e. M.Arch. has been running from the academic session 2007-08.
</br> </br>
 

In the academic year 2013-14, three new PG prgrammes are running  i.e. M.Tech. in Power System Engineering (in the Department of Electrical Engineering), Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering (in the Department of Instrumentation & Electronics Engineering), Biotechnology  (in the Department of Biotechnology) and 02-years M.Sc. in Applied Chemistry (in Chemistry Department) are introduced from the current academic year 2014-15.

 </br> </br>

In the current academic year 2014-15, Odisha State Govt. introduced nine new PG prgrammes i.e. M.Tech. in Water Resources Engineering (in the Department of Civil Engineering), Geotechnical Engineering (in the Department of Civil Engineering), Power Electronics & Drives (in the Department of Electrical Engineering),   Energy System Engineering (in the Department of Electrical Engineering), Electronics & Communication Engineering (in the Department of Instrumentation & Electronics Engineering), Signal Processing Engineering (in the Department of Instrumentation & Electronics Engineering), Thermal Engineering (in the Department of Mechanical Engineering), Design & Dynamics (in the Department of Mechanical  Engineering),Textile Chemical Processing  (in the Department of Textile Engineering). Also four numbers of Integrated courses like 05-years Integrated M.Sc. in Mathematics and Computing, 02-years M.Sc. in Mathematics and Computing, 05-years Integrated M.Sc. in Applied Physics, 02-years M.Sc. in Applied Physics and 05-years Integrated M.Sc. in Applied Chemistry are introduced from the current academic year 2014-15.
